My parents want to start a restaurant and for that I decided that maybe for fun, I'll create a bespoke solution to handling payments and stocks. I'm thinking of adding 
other features that may help run the restaurant. 

For that, I will need to list out the requirements and so good old whopping-out of a word document to outline inputs, outputs, requirements, features, et cetera. 
 
I think it's important to carefully plan the project before heading right in, planning will save the project from infrastucture issues that may prove to be costly to recover from later on.

I will need to think about what tools I'll be using, serverless or monolithic infrastructure? Who knows... I'll think more about that and come back to this post.
